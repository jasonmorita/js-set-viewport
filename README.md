js-set-viewport-based
=====================

JavaScript to set meta viewport for desktop sites squeezing down to mobile that are big and have a fixed width. Ran into an issue where the site would not scale down to screen width if using width=device-width. Seemed to only be related to the way this site was coded and the way tablets reacted to it. Refactoring site not an option.
